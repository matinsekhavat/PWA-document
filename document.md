# PWA - Document

### App Manifest

- manifest.json is a file which include all PWA configs , such as : name , icons , display(standalone - browser) theme color and ... others options that we can set in manifest.json file.

in second step when we want to deploy we should set an `SSL` for that.(our URL need SSL)

so we need a package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server">http-server</a>

```bash
npm i -g http-server
```
